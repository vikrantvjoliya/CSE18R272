/* Create a class called Book to represent a book.
 A Book should include four pieces of information as instance variablesa book name, an ISBN number, an author name and a publisher.
  Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables.
 Provide a mutator method and accessor method (query method) for each instance variable.
  Inaddition, provide a method named getBookInfo that returns the description of the book as a String
   (the description should include all the information about the book).
   You should use this keyword in member methods and constructor. 
   Write a test application named BookTest 
   to create an array of object for 30 elements for class Book to demonstrate the class Book's capabilities.*/
