/*Create class SavingsAccount. Usea static variable annualInterestRate to store the
annual interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a
private instance variable savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver
currently has ondeposit. Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate
the monthly interest by multiplying the savingsBalance by annualInterestRate
divided by 12 this interest should be added to savingsBalance. Provide a static
method modifyInterestRate th 
Provide a static
method modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new value.
Write a program to test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two savingsAccount
objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively.
Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest and print the
new balances for both savers. Then set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the
next monthâ€™s interest and print the new balances for both savers.
