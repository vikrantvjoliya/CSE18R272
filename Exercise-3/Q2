/*
Create a Circle class with following members.

A data member that stores the radius of a circle
A constructor function with an argument that initializes the radius
A function that computes and returns are of a circle
Create two derived classes Sector and Segment that inherit the Circle class.
Both classes inherit radius and the function that returns the circle&#39;s area from
Circle. In addition to the members inherited from Circle, Sector and Segment
have some specific members as follows:
Sector
A data member that stores the control angle of a sector(in radians)
A constructor function with arguments that initialize radius and angle
A function that computes and returns the area of a sector
Segment
A data member that stores the angle of a segment in a circle
A constructor function with arguments that initialize radius and angle
A function that computes and returns the area of a segment
Create the main () function to instantiate an object of each class and then call
appropriate member functions to compute and return the area of a circle,
sector and segment.
Note :Area_of_circle =π r 2
Area_of_Sector=r 2 θ/2
Area_of_segment= ½ * r 2 ( θ – sin θ)
