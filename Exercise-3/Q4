/*Design a vehicle class that contains the following properties of motor vehicles:
Fuel tank capacity, average fuel consumption per 100 km and the distance a
vehicle can travel on a full tank. The vehicle class should be designed as a base
class from which the Car and Truck classes are derived. The derived classes
should have following member functions.
 A function that contains data for a vehicle from the user
 A function that computes and returns the distance a vehicle can travel on a
full tank.
 A function that computes and returns how many times a vehicle has to be
refueled to travel a given distance.
Test the class in the main method.*/
