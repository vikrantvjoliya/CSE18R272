  1.Develop a java application with Employee class with Emp_name, Emp_id,
  Address, Mail_id, Mobile_no as members. Inherit the classes, Programmer,
  Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor from employee class.
  Add Basic Pay (BP) as the member of all the inherited classes with 97% of BP as
  DA, 10 % of BP as HRA, 12% of BP as PF, 0.1% of BP for staff club fund.
  Generate pay slips for the employees with their gross and net salary
  
  2.Create a Circle class with following members.
  A data member that stores the radius of a circle
  A constructor function with an argument that initializes the radius
  A function that computes and returns are of a circle
  Create two derived classes Sector and Segment that inherit the Circle class.
  Both classes inherit radius and the function that returns the circle&#39;s area from
  Circle. In addition to the members inherited from Circle, Sector and Segment
  have some specific members as follows:
  Sector
  A data member that stores the control angle of a sector(in radians)
  A constructor function with arguments that initialize radius and angle
  A function that computes and returns the area of a sector
  Segment
  A data member that stores the angle of a segment in a circle
  A constructor function with arguments that initialize radius and angle
  A function that computes and returns the area of a segment
  Create the main () function to instantiate an object of each class and then call
  appropriate member functions to compute and return the area of a circle,
  sector and segment.
  Note :Area_of_circle =π r 2
  Area_of_Sector=r 2 θ/2
  Area_of_segment= ½ * r 2 ( θ – sin θ)

  3.Create a base class Shape with relevant data members and member functions to
  get data and print the area. Create two more classes Rectangle and Triangle
  which inherit Shape class. Test the classes in main method.
